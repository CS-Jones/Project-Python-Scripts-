# Project-Python-Scripts-
Scripts for last year project - sentiment analysis

The aim of this project was to investigate state-of-the-art approaches to sentiment analysis gained from
tweets, with the sentiment gained this would help to implement and produce systems to automatically
stream tweets and measure the sentiment from the tweets based on a certain phase or keyword.
The focus of the project was to answer data science questions using the data gained from streaming the
tweets such as – if language changed based on time.

The system will be created mainly with python to gain the data from tweets along with using python to
do the main chuck of the work it will be used to produce graphs based on stored tweets from a JSON
file.

he whole prototype uses several technologies to create the working prototype for the project, while
python does most of the back-end work to compliment this the prototype has a website tied to it to show
the graphs and information gained from the back-end work.

The general idea of the project is to look at sentiment analysis on tweets with a possibility to investigate
and research state of the art approaches to these problems and use the knowledge we gained to produce
a prototype. This prototype system will be used to support users in performing language usage analysis
takes from social media data this data will be either stored offline or streamed live (Via Twitter Stream
API)

The aim for this project will be to try to add various ways of expanding the tweets to include sentiment
analysis – The project aims to be able to search tweets using keywords and measure the emotion
contained in the word using this information.

Finally, during this project, we want to try and answer several data science questions such as e.g. is
there any significant difference in the use of positive words between daytime and nighttime?
The plan to use this project to attempt to answer these questions using the planned-out methods
(sentiment analysis) and how once we have the data we can produce meaningful information using
several different data visualization techniques to allow people to visualize and interact with the outputs
from the data science questions. Our Stage of the project would be producing the GUI, so users could
interact with the data we gained during the process such as real-time data visualization
